                BACnet is a communication protocol for Building Automation and Control (BAC) networks that leverage the
                ASHRAE, ANSI, and ISO 16484-5 standard[1] protocol.

                BACnet was designed to allow communication of building automation and control systems for applications
                such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control (HVAC), lighting control, access control, and
                fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms for
                computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular building
                service they perform.
